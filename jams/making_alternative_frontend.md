### Details:
**_Task_**: Learn to use web scraping to build an alternative frontend

**_Requirements_**:  Python3 runtime, can be local or in the browser

**_Language used_**: Python

**_Customization opportunity_**: Everybody will scrape a different website, but with the guidance to select which websites would work well and instructions on how to modify their code to work with whatever website they are scraping. Everybody's website output will also be different as they will need to display different data.

**_Platform Limitations_**: It works for all platforms with a browser, or you can run python locally.

**_Time estimation_**: 1-2 hours~

**_Skill level_**: Intermediate-Advanced

### Breakdown
- Setup: Setting up a development environment, most likely to be in the cloud (Codespaces, Replit, etc...) (5 mins)
- Part 1: Choosing a website to scrape (10 mins)
- Part 2: Fetching the site contents (10 mins)
- Part 3: Extracting the important data/content from the website (30-40 mins)
- Part 4: Displaying the extracted content in your custom frontend (30-40 mins)

### Questions:
1. How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e., how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)?
- Everybody will scrape different websites, and will display different content/data on their website's frontend.
2. Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
- Websites nowdays are constantly getting more and more annoying, not to mention the widespread use of invasive trackers, and bloat. With this jam, high schoolers will be able to learn how to overcome these difficulties by designing their own frontend for popular websites. Building alternative frontends generally makes the internet a better place by improving privacy and overall making the website more pleasant to use. For example, an alternative frontend could greatly simplify a website, strip trackers and ads, and make is much lighter. 
3. What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
- They will walk away with the knowledge to scrape websites, and display that scraped data in their own unique way.
4. What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
- Web scraping is an interesting prospect because it allows hackers to easily harvest data from a website and use it freely to create transformative websites of their own.
5. What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
- Any platform with a browser, or any platform that can run python.
